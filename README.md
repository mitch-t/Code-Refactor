# Code-Refactor

This is the first project I've worked on. I'm working on organizing code and reducing redundancies. 
Made changes to the code so that all links work and images are displayed. I also added semantic elements to the 
code and enlarged the text to make the site more user friendly. Working and reviewing this project has helped me 
better understand sequence of code to create a user freindly webpage. I plan on revisting this project to improve 
the code as I learn more about html and css.
